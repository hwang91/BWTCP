BWTCP
=====

Efficiently construct BWT for large collection of genomic reads

As there exist only 3 files, we didn't provide a makefile, you can simple run
  gcc -O3 FileName.c -o FILENAME
for the three .c files.

Please refer to bwtcp.sh for instructions. 
You may need to modify the script as you will see there.

Feel free to contact hwang@nudt.edu.cn if you have any questions.
